Geographic Information System or GIS can be defined as a system that is used to describe or explain the circumstances of the earth into a geographic data.

Real world concept is a way to change the reality of how GIS physical state of the Earth using the model into a geographic information system that can be stored, and manipulated in a state dirpresentasikan 2D.

Latitude is a right transverse line located between the north pole and the south pole, which connects the eastern and western sides on the earth. This line has membentangi position of the earth, just as the equator, but with conditions specified value. This became latitude in measuring the size of a north-south coordinate of a point in the hemisphere.

longitude is a longitudinal line that connects between the north side and the south side of the earth is at the poles. This longitude is used to measure the side of the east-west coordinate of a point in the hemisphere.

The conclusion from the above discussion that the geographic information system on the state of the earth discuss the state of the 3D transformed into state of the Earth in 2D which is calculated using the latitude and longitude.
