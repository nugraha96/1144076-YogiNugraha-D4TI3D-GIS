1. Background

In the times of modern versatile as today, may use maps are rarely seen let alone use too ribet.Hal the spur develop to develop applications such as digital map or perhaps an example that we know like google maps.Kita must have wondered how create maps on google maps.Sebelum like it here I will explain the basics in making maps.

2.Identifikasi Problems

What is a spatial data?
Explain briefly about the data spasisal?
3.Penjelasan Problems and Solutions

Geographic information is information bumi.yang surface appearance make the information contained in the form of an element of geographical position, spatial relationships, attributes and time.

Spatial data is a data-oriented a geographical, which has a specific coordinate system as a reference base and has two important parts which makes it different from other data, the location information (spatial) and descriptive information (attributes):

own spatial coordinates associated with a good geographic coordinates such as latitude and longitude, and coordinates XYZ
attribute is a location that has some information related to it.
The location information or geometric property of spatial objects can be included in some form such as the following:

The point is the simplest form of graphics for spatial objects.
The line is a linear geometric shapes that would connect at least two points and are used to represent objects that are one-dimensional.
Polygon is used to represent the two-dimensional objects.
Surface in this case relating to the physical phenomena (spatial) that has a location in space, which includes a three-dimensional space dimension.
In Geographic Information Systems Spatial data can be represented in two formats, namely:

Vector Data is a form of the earth that were presented in a collection of lines, area, point and nodes.
Raster data is the data generated from the sensing system jauh.yang represented as a grid or a pixel cell structure.
4. Conclusions and Recommendations

So kesimpulanya spatial data is a geographically oriented data, has a specific coordinate system as a reference base and has two important parts which makes it different from the data lain.Dimana spatial data consists of vector data and raster data.
