Shapefile is a tool that can perform the calculation amount to an object, for example as we discuss here is coastline, in this case the shapefile will calculate the objects found on the coastline.
Python is an interpretive programming language with a multi-use design philosophy that focuses on code readability level.
before the start of the call shapefiles, we install pip and pyshp.
pip is a package management system that is used to install and manage the software packages written in the programming language Python.
pyshp is a python library that serves to be read shapefiles.

Conclusions and recommendations
